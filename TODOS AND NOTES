printFmtutils.hpp 003:   NOTE(skc):
                         SA https://gist.github.com/fnky/458719343aabd01cfb17a3a4f7296797
printFmtutils.hpp 035:   NOTE(skc) : ANSI specifies that 1,1 is the top left of the screen.. not 0,0

CVar.hpp 023:            NOTE(skc) : I don't think I am going to like this syntax but
                         I don't know a better way of doing this.
                         as<T>() just seems gross...  would much prefer as(T)..
                         the reason that I am making it so it returns an empty optional instead of
                         throwing to keep the logic code more clean.
                         it also helps to abstract away the difference between the C_var being set or not.
 
parse_cvars.hpp 018:     NOTE(skc): have to do this here to get the first arg
parse_cvars.hpp 042:     NOTE(skc): and this here to get the last.
 
Events.hpp 199:          NOTE(skc) m_cursor_position is set by both the mouse and any JOYSTICS
                         where as m_mouse_position is the raw mouse position.
Events.hpp 245:          NOTE(skc) : this is not const because it is kinda important to not ignore the user when they
                         drop something into the aplication so the flag is only cleared when the consumer calls this function.
Events.hpp 247:          NOTE(skc) :IF YOU'RE TRYING TO ACCEPT DATA FROM "DROP" EVENTS CALL THIS EVERY FRAME DO NOT
                         MAKE YOUR USERS WAIT FOR THEIR INPUT TO BE PROCESSED!
Events.hpp 418:          NOTE(skc) : I set the m_arrow_state even if arrow_keys_alias_WASD is true because
                         the consumer may still have contextual reasons to treat the arrow keys differently
                         while still wanting them to alias their respective keys.
Events.hpp 442:          NOTE(skc) : for some reason the char codes for the KP are
                         1234567890 not the ASCII layout of 0123456789 ...
                         this takes the key code and sets the respective bit
Events.hpp 501:          NOTE(SKC): FORMAT_STRING_GET is assumed to be undefed at the end of this function
                         things may break if you remove the #undef FORMAT_STRING_GET.
 
Window.hpp 047:          NOTE(skc) we may have to implement these;
Window.hpp 363:          NOTE(skc): YOU REALLY SHOULD NOT USE THIS MEMBER FUNCTION (AS IT RETURNS A RAW POINTER!!!).
                         it is only public for the SDL functions that are not wrapped in the ID based API yet.
                         once I am sure that all of the SDL functions are wrapped in the ID based API I will make this private.
                         I make no guarantees that this will not cause a use after free error.
                         Though it should not be possible based off of how classes work in C++.
Window.hpp 404:          NOTE(skc): this is the API that you should be using by default. the only reason
                         you would use the SDL_Texture* API is if you are using a texture that is generated progrimatically.
 
ini_map_t.hpp 214:       NOTE This should always be called with Template argument deduction...
                         the reson this has an auto return type is because I want a string when the type is char const*.
 
read_settings.hpp 039:   NOTE(skc) : the pre increment here is intentional as I want to remove the brakets
 
 
lua_cxx.hpp 027:         NOTE(skc) : the Lua state should be a singleton more or less.
                         if you need to make your own lua state you're most likely doing something wrong...
 
main.hpp 016:            NOTE(skc): This has to be a reference to preven use after free...
                         (possible bug in lua_close [not checking for the value being null])
 
 
 
sdl_3_ge.cpp 091:        NOTE(skc): I know that this is bad practice get off my back.
