                              there's like a lot of them though so that might have to be itsown file...

game_pad.hpp:020              TODO(skc): exstend this to return the names of the hat and axises

parse_cvars.hpp:010           TODO(skc): This still needs work! 
                              should make this better

Events.hpp:015                TODO(skc) : move to own file?

 Events.hpp:341               TODO(skc) : distinguish between the KP and main layout numbers.

key_mod.hpp:101               TODO(skc) : implement -> SDL_KMOD_LEVEL5

key_mod.hpp:108               TODO(SKC) : make this so that it only outputs in dbg mode...

Window.hpp:023                TODO (skc) : move all of this filesystem 
                              stuff to own file.

Window.hpp:078                TODO(skc) : make this fail some way...

Window.hpp:125                TODO(skc): add getter and settere for window 
                              fullscreen display mode.

Window.hpp:159                TODO (skc) : create a resource class.

Window.hpp:546                TODO(skc) : handle error

Vector.hpp:057                TODO(SKC): move to own file.
                               this should be in own file because there is no other reason that format is included in this file.
                              TODO(SKC) : make this so that it only outputs in dbg mode...

strmanip.hpp:013              TODO(skc): make this return expected.

== FIXMEs ==
key_mod.hpp:129               FIXME(skc): this should throw if *pos != '}' 
                              because this should error when it is not. 
                              however this is not an huge issue...

ini_map_t.hpp:277             FIXME(skc): 
                              This is a workaround for the fact that intellisense doesn't support C++26's 
                              multidimensional subscript operator for some reason. I promise this can compile with CL the AI seems to
                              think that it works in GCC too, but I haven't tested it yet.

read_settings.hpp:051         FIXME(skc) this should return an unexpected


==  NOTES ==
printFmtutils.hpp:010         NOTE(skc): 
                               SA https://gist.github.com/fnky/458719343aabd01cfb17a3a4f7296797

printFmtutils.hpp:042         NOTE(skc) : ANSI specifies that 1,1 is the top left of the screen.. not 0,0

CVar.hpp:024                  NOTE(skc) : I don't think I am going to like this syntax but 
                              I don't know a better way of doing this. 
                              as<T>() just seems gross...  would much prefer as(T)..  
                              the reason that I am making it so it returns an empty optional instead of 
                              throwing to keep the logic code more clean.
                               it also helps to abstract away the difference between the C_var being set or not.

parse_cvars.hpp:019           NOTE(skc): have to do this here to get the first arg

parse_cvars.hpp:043           NOTE(skc): and this here to get the last.

Events.hpp:081                NOTE(skc) m_cursor_position is set by both the mouse and any JOYSTICS 
                              where as m_mouse_position is the raw mouse position.

Events.hpp:128                NOTE(skc) : this is not const because it is kinda important to not ignore the user when they
                               drop something into the aplication so the flag is only cleared when the consumer calls this function.	
                              NOTE(skc) :IF YOU'RE TRYING TO ACCEPT DATA FROM "DROP" EVENTS CALL THIS EVERY FRAME DO NOT
                              MAKE YOUR USERS WAIT FOR THEIR INPUT TO BE PROCESSED!

Events.hpp:157                NOTE(skc) : this is impossible to happen 
                              but its better to be safe than sorry!

Events.hpp:314                NOTE(skc) : I set the m_arrow_state even if arrow_keys_alias_WASD is true because 
                              the consumer may still have contextual reasons to treat the arrow keys differently 
                              while still wanting them to alias their respective keys.

Events.hpp:338                NOTE(skc) : for some reason the char codes for the KP are 
                              1234567890 not the ASCII layout of 0123456789 ... 
                              this takes the key code and sets the respective bit

key_mod.hpp:110               NOTE(SKC): FORMAT_STRING_GET is assumed to be undefed at the end of this function  
                               things may break if you remove the #undef FORMAT_STRING_GET.

texture.hpp:024               NOTE(skc) we may have to implement these;

Window.hpp:359                NOTE(skc): YOU REALLY SHOULD NOT USE THIS MEMBER FUNCTION (AS IT RETURNS A RAW POINTER!!!).
                              it is only public for the SDL functions that are not wrapped in the ID based API yet. 
                              once I am sure that all of the SDL functions are wrapped in the ID based API I will make this private.
                              I make no guarantees that this will not cause a use after free error.
                              Though it should not be possible based off of how classes work in C++.

Window.hpp:400                NOTE(skc): this is the API that you should be using by default. the only reason 
                              you would use the SDL_Texture* API is if you are using a texture that is generated progrimatically.

Window.hpp:591                NOTE(skc) : doing this here so that the surface gets freed
                              no matter what

Window.hpp:596                NOTE(skc) :
                                 anchor point | translation
                              ---------------------------
                                  AP_FLOATING | (w*ox, h*oy)
                               AP_TOP_LEFT    | ( 0  ,  0  )  
                               AP_CENTER_LEFT | ( 0  , -h/2)
                               AP_BOTTOM_LEFT | ( 0  , -h  ) 
                                 AP_TOP_RIGHT | (-w  ,  0  )
                              AP_CENTER_RIGHT | (-w  , -h/2)
                              AP_BOTTOM_RIGHT | (-w  , -h  )
                                    AP_CENTER | (-w/2, -h/2)

ini_map_t.hpp:215             NOTE This should always be called with Template argument deduction...
                              the reson this has an auto return type is because I want a string when the type is char const*.

read_settings.hpp:040         NOTE(skc) : the pre increment here is intentional as I want to remove the brakets

sdl_3_ge.cpp:177              NOTE(skc): I know that this is bad practice get off my back.
