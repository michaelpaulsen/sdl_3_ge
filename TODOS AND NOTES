Vector.hpp 056:          TODO(SKC): move to own file.
                         this should be in own file because there is no other reason that format is included in this file.

== FIXMEs ==
 
 
 
Events.hpp 431:          FIXME(skc): this should throw if *pos != '}'
                         because this should error when it is not.
                         however this is not an huge issue...

==  NOTES ==
 
CVar.hpp 024:            NOTE(skc) : I don't think I am going to like this syntax but
                         I don't know a better way of doing this.
                         as<T>() just seems gross...  would much prefer as(T)..
                         the reason that I am making it so it returns an empty optional instead of
                         throwing to keep the logic code more clean.
                         it also helps to abstract away the difference between the C_var being set or not.
 
ECS.hpp 121:             NOTE(skc) : this is going to be the only example of polymorphism in the
                         whole project...
                         this may still not be the best way to do it...
ECS.hpp 128:             NOTE(skc) : we don't want to move the ECS because it should be unquie.
 
Events.hpp 184:          NOTE(skc) m_cursor_position is set by both the mouse and any JOYSTICS
                         where as m_mouse_position is the raw mouse position.
                         the way that this is updated makes it theroetically possible to miss imputs when the same input is
                         inputed more than once a frame but even at 30 fps that is nearly imposible
                         + I think that every GE in existance has a simular system...
Events.hpp 223:          NOTE(skc) : this is not const because it is kinda important to not ignore the user when they
                         drop something into the aplication so the flag is only cleared when the consumer calls this function.
Events.hpp 225:          NOTE(skc) :IF YOU'RE TRYING TO ACCEPT DATA FROM "DROP" EVENTS CALL THIS EVERY FRAME DO NOT
                         MAKE YOUR USERS WAIT FOR THEIR INPUT TO BE PROCESSED!
Events.hpp 345:          NOTE(skc) : I set the m_arrow_state even if arrow_keys_alias_WASD is true because
                         the consumer may still have contextual reasons to treat the arrow keys differently
                         while still wanting them to alias their respective keys.
Events.hpp 369:          NOTE(skc) : for some reason the char codes for the KP are
                         1234567890 not the ASCII layout of 0123456789 ...
                         this takes the key code and sets the respective bit
Events.hpp 412:          NOTE(SKC): FORMAT_STRING_GET is assumed to be undefed at the end of this function
                         things may break if you remove the #undef FORMAT_STRING_GET.

lua_cxx.hpp 027:         NOTE(skc) : the Lua state should be a singleton more or less.
                         if you need to make your own lua state
 
main.hpp 033:            NOTE(skc): This has to be a reference to preven use after free...
                         (possible bug in lua_close [not checking for the value being null])
main.hpp 080:            NOTE(skc): have to do this here to get the first arg
main.hpp 106:            NOTE(skc): and this here to get the last.
 
printFmtutils.hpp 004:   NOTE(skc):
                         SA https://gist.github.com/fnky/458719343aabd01cfb17a3a4f7296797
printFmtutils.hpp 036:   NOTE(skc) : ANSI specifies that 1,1 is the top left of the screen.. not 0,0
 
Room.hpp 010:            NOTE(skc) MVC++23's ABI is not finalized yet so they don't define this
                         automatically but the feature is present
                         so I am going to define
                         _cpp_multidimensional_subscript
                         
Room.hpp 021:            NOTE(skc) there's no reason that this shouldn't work with floating point types but IDK how I want to repersent them. `1
Room.hpp 034:            NOTE(skc): by default this should only take 1 byte per cell but 255 tile ids is limiting so
                         I templated it.
 
 
Window.hpp 040:          NOTE(skc) we may have to implement these;
Window.hpp 105:          NOTE(skc) : yes this does matter...

Window.hpp 278:          NOTE(skc): YOU REALLY SHOULD NOT USE THIS MEMBER FUNCTION (AS IT RETURNS A RAW POINTER!!!).
                         it is only public for the SDL functions that are not wrapped in the ID based API yet.
                         once I am sure that all of the SDL functions are wrapped in the ID based API I will make this private.
                         I make no guarantees that this will not cause a use after free error.
                         Though it should not be possible based off of how classes work in C++.

Window.hpp 317:          NOTE(skc): this is the API that you should be using by default. the only reason
                         you would use the SDL_Texture* API is if you are using a texture that is generated progrimatically.
